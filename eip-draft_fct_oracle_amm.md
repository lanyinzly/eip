## Abstract

This proposal defines a system which inbeds a Function Oracle that can wrap fungible tokens to non-fungible token and unwrap the non-fungible back to fungible tokens. The presetted Function Oracle provides its own Automated Market Maker(AMM) so that it guarantees the liquidity of the NFT's credit.

## Motivation

The motivation behind a wrapping system with inbeded Function Oracle AMM is to provide decentralized credit endorsement and thus quantifiable decentralized credit assets with liquidity. This creates an applicable infrastructure for credit creation, transmission, and oracle in payment, social, and financial context. Decentralized credit voucher can be implemented in the form of Non-fungible tokens, compatible with current Ethereum environment, which also expands its application scenarios. The concept of decentralized credit is highly integrated with dApps development. It aims to foster a more trustless environment.
Under current framework of pool, it is hard for user to define how to manage the pool without coding. However, we believe it should be more accessible for users to define and create their own pools to energize the market. Through employing FTs as premium for NFTs under a customizable framework, such an approach standardize the process of creating a pool and allows users to gain the ability to "do it yourself."


## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Contract Interfaces: 
There are two interfaces SHALL be implemented as they are mutually bounded. One is an agency which wrap and unwrap the token with a function oracle, and another one is the wrapper, or the issuer of the vouchers.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

No backward compatibility issues found.



## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
